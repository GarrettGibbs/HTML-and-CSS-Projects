                    Some people go to the movies to be wowed by the superb acting, heart wrenching and well written story, and overall solid production... THIS has good effects? The acting in this film isn't bad, but it definitely won't win any awards for it.
                    The story has characters Bill Randa (John Goodman) and Houston Brooks (Corey Hawkins) piggybacking on an expedition to an uncharted island to test their "hollow earth" theory. Tom Hiddleston plays a tracker, Brie Larson plays a photographer, and John C. Reilly plays a surprisingly funny WW2 vet marooned on Skull Island.
                    The film takes place in 1973 and loves to remind you with CCR and old technology as if it was a hundred years ago. Kong: Skull Island pays homage to Apocalypse Now quite frequently even though it seems a bit excessive at times.
                    Kong looked good, almost all the creatures looked cool and all the fights between them looked really good, especially in IMAX 3D. Some of the green screen effects, like backgrounds behind characters, were distractingly bad. Ultimately, you get some great stuff out of all the effects if you're not looking too closely.
                    The characters are more hollow than the earth (according to the film's characters themselves), the story is mediocre, but the effects reign king in this film adaptation.
                    My suggestion: See it! it's a blockbuster meant to fill seats, not win awards. Take it for what it is.

                  This should have at least a score of 8.5, i cant believe i'm seeing 6.9 all you over critical men who are worse than women on there periods! THIS IS A CLASSIC! in my eyes one of my favourite films iv'e watched in a long time, i would put it beside blade runner as my favourite sci fi film.
                  I've seen all the Films of GHOST IN THE SHELL. I was actually doubting for a minute when i read a few reviews but now i know its all bull****!! its all them ..whatever you call them people who don't believe it lived up to there expectation when it actually did! so they lie and make other fans think its not good when its more than that, because this film was soo good, the actors played the characters to a T! Great cast! Batou was my favourite! his and majors friendship you could feel the harmony between them and that they cared for each other, you could get a sense of that straight away which was great! also the music i loved it! it had a 80's electronic style to it, this film has great colours and great shots and THE CAR IS JUST AMAZING! second behind the delorean no doubt. Main thing was.. it lingered on me, some films now i go see and forget about it the next day but this stuck on me and i couldn't stop thinking how good it was! So don't listen to these negative reviews people this is a gem of a film and they put so much work into this they don't deserve all this critical negative attitude. They deserve praise for bringing this to Cinema and delivering.

                  At first I was skeptical about this movie, and then, month by month, I started to get very hyped and excited. Nevertheless, I still had my doubts regarding the director - I mean seriously, Twilight? Seriously?!? What was Bill Condon thinking when he accepted to involve himself in that sparkly mess? And of course, this extended to Emma Watson and Dan Stevens, as I could not imagine them worthy of playing my all time favorite characters from my favorite movie... Yes, I followed Dan's career since he played Edward Ferrars in "Sense and Sensibility" and I am a convinced Potterhead so Emma's acting skills were never in question.
                  I even postponed watching it because I was sooo afraid of spoiling the picture perfect created by the 1991 version, and also because I had read some reviews that were not so favorable...
                  Nevertheless, last Sunday I went to the theater, heart in my teeth, stomach in knots, expecting a big letdown. But, something magical happened from the very first scene. I forgot how to breathe properly, I barely blinked, entranced as I was by this marvelous piece of cinematography. I cried, squealed with delight, laughed, sobbed, sang along when my favorite tunes started and listened to the new ones breathlessly... I felt my heart grow heavy so many times, feeling I'm still experiencing on a daily basis whilst listening to the soundtrack...
                  Every moment, every image, every song, it all combines in an unique experience, enhanced by the 3D technology, compelling many of us to re-experience it again, and again, and again
                  Ultimately, my advice is to go watch this movie, with an open heart and you won't be disappointed. Haters will be haters, they will continue to bash this movie, write negative reviews and advice against it. Don't follow my example, don't listen to my advice, do the smart thing and experience it yourself and then let your heart decide....
